# autorepair-ui

UI for autorepair-api

I will build a basic UI that will generate and submit a random jobs to the server to be checked.
For that I will use Visual Studio Code 1.38.1, node v10.15.3 Angular 7.2.15.

I add Bootstrap 4.3.1 adding the link to index file.

I create the models to be sent to the server, a submit service and a fake structure to check the connection.

When it is created I add a little form to the html. I add it to the ts component, add events, the random sheet generation and that is all.

As the sheet generation is random, is really hard to find an approved or referred example with the web app, so I included some example in the code.
